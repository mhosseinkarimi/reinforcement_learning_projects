# Welcome to My RL Exploration

Here, I will share my journey of RL and my exploration through the field (pun intended) and hopefully, you will find it interesting too! 

## Overview
I will focus on the basics of Reinforcement Learning including but not limited to:

* Introduction to the Basic Concepts:
    - Agents, Action and State spaces
    - Value Functions, Q-Values, Reward, and Reutrn
    - Markov Decision Process and Policy
* Tabular RL:
    - Policy Iteration, Value Iteration and Dynamic Programming
    - Monte-Carlo Methods
    - SARSA
    - Temporal Difference
    - Q-Leanring
* Approximate Solution Methods
    - On-Policy Prediction & Control
    - Off-Policy Methods
    - Policy Gradient Methods

And more to come ... :smiley:

## Resources
The main resources that I will follow during this course are the following:

1. [COMP 579: Reinforcement Learining](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~comp579/W25/index.html) lectures presented at McGill University by amazing [Dr. Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/).
2. [Reinforcement Learning Online Lectures](https://www.aparat.com/playlist/9319081) presented at Sharif University of Technology (in Farsi) by [Dr. Mohammadhossein Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/).
3. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
